### Adversarial Noise Protection

**Revolutionary AI Training Defense**

Our adversarial noise protection adds imperceptible mathematical perturbations to your images that disrupt neural network training while keeping images visually identical to humans.

**How It Works:**

- Applies carefully calculated noise patterns using advanced algorithms
- Three protection methods: Gaussian (recommended), Uniform, and Perlin noise
- Intensity levels 1-10 for customizable protection strength
- Noise amplitude automatically calculated for optimal effectiveness

**Protection Methods:**

- **Gaussian Noise**: Most effective against CNN-based AI models
- **Uniform Noise**: General-purpose protection for various AI architectures
- **Perlin Noise**: Structured patterns that resist filtering attempts

**Technical Details:**

- Noise amplitude: 0.001-0.02 (intensity-dependent)
- Applied at pixel level using Sharp image processing
- Survives common image operations (resize, compression)
- Mathematically designed to maximize AI training disruption

**Usage:**

- Enable via "AI Training Protection" toggle in the UI
- Select protection method and intensity
- Server-side processing ensures precise noise application
- Combined with watermarks and EXIF for multi-layer defense

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Upload Fails**

   - Verify file size (max 30MB)
   - Check file format (JPG/PNG only)
   - Ensure proper MIME type

2. **EXIF Protection**

   - Confirm image format supports EXIF
   - Check server logs for metadata errors
   - Verify Sharp library installation

3. **Server Port**
   - Default port is 5002
   - Can be changed via PORT env variable
   - Check for port conflicts

## Deployment Guide

### Understanding the Application

Before deploying, it's important to understand how the app works:

1. **Frontend Processing:**

   - Initial watermark preview
   - Client-side image manipulation
   - Real-time UI updates

2. **Backend Processing:**
   - EXIF metadata injection
   - High-quality image processing
   - Temporary file handling during processing

### Railway Deployment Steps

1. **Prerequisites**

   ```bash
   # Make sure you have:
   - A Railway account (railway.app)
   - Railway CLI installed
   - Git installed
   ```

2. **Project Setup**

   ```bash
   # Initialize Railway project
   railway login
   railway init
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   In Railway dashboard:

   - Add `NODE_ENV=production`
   - Add `PORT=5002` (or let Railway assign automatically)

4. **Deployment Process**

   ```bash
   # Push your code
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   railway up
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check Railway dashboard for build logs
   - Ensure all environment variables are set
   - Test the deployed application endpoints

### Important Railway-specific Notes

1. **Port Configuration**

   - Railway automatically assigns a PORT
   - Application already handles this via process.env.PORT

2. **Node.js Version**

   - Required: Node.js >= 20.0.0
   - Add to package.json:

   ```json
   "engines": {
     "node": ">=20.0.0"
   }
   ```

3. **Memory Management**

   - Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
   - Files are stored briefly during processing only
   - No persistent storage needed
   - Railway's ephemeral filesystem is sufficient

4. **Monitoring**
   - Use Railway's built-in logs
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check application logs for cleanup service

### Troubleshooting Railway Deployment

1. **Build Fails**

   - Check Node.js version in package.json
   - Verify all dependencies are listed
   - Review Railway build logs

2. **Runtime Errors**

   - Check environment variables
   - Verify PORT configuration
   - Review application logs

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check file processing times
   - Verify cleanup service is running
